### Project Overview

 Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. However, modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products and imbalanced label distribution (most of the feedbacks are "Fit").

As a data scientist your aim is to predict the customer satisfaction. This dataset contain imformation regarding clothes. Each observation is different fitting size with various features.

The dataset has details of 82790 users with the following 11 features :

| Features | Description                        |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| bra_size | Integer Value                      |
| Category | Clothes Category                   |
| cup_size | Bra Cup Size                       |
| fit      | Target Variable, Fit/ Small/ Large |
| height   | Height of the Cloth                |
| hips     | Size of the hips                   |
| item_id  | Item ID Number                     |
| length   | Length of the cloth                |
| quality  | Rating given by customer           |
| size     | Size of the cloth                  |
| userId   | User ID                            |
