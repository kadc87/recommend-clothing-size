### Project Overview

 Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers’ shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. However, modeling customers’ fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products and imbalanced label distribution (most of the feedbacks are "Fit").

As a data scientist your aim is to predict the customer satisfaction. This dataset contain imformation regarding clothes. Each observation is different fitting size with various features.

The dataset has details of 82790 users with the following 11 features :

Feature	      Description

bra_size	    integer value

category	    In which category clothes belong

cup_size	    size of the cloth

fit	         Target variable (fit/large/small)

height	      Height of the customer

hips	        Size of the hips

item_id	     Id number

length	      Length of the cloth

quality	     Rating given by customer

size	        size of the cloth

userId	      userID
